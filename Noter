Noter was an Interesting Machine, That I've learned few of these things:
  1. Search for the backend web technology and try to google for it's common exploit technique.
  2. Flask Cookie Signing
  3. Mysql Privilege Escalation using raptor_udf2.so
  
 Exploitation begins by creating an account and logging in. Once logged in we see the jwt token. Decode it, and we see the following structure:
  {
    "logged_in": true,
    "username": <username>
   }
   
Since it is using flask, we brute force secret used to sign these cookies, using flask-unsign

Once we found the secret, we bruteforce the common usernames, by creating a new jwt tokens, and fuzzing this on headers, until we see 200 response.

Then we get the username and password using which we ftp and found the admin password from the policy.

Once obtaining the policy, we ftp and get the backups. 

From the backups we can see that it is using vulnerable version of md-to-pdf, using which, we gain RCE

We can see the credentials of mysqldb in the backups, so, after getting reverse shell, we login to mysql, and exploit mysql using techniques mentioned in
